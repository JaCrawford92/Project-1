## Name of Game 
<h4>The Game of Myths</h4>

## Description
Are you ready to test your might? This Trivia Game focuses on Mythology, and you can choose between 4 difficulties after clicking "start game". After going through the game you will be told how well you did and then given the option to start the game over.

As someone who loves Mytholoy, I wanted to make a trivia game where players can hava a little fun and learn something they might've not known at first.

<strong>Welcome and Enjoy!!</strong>
